# MEDIVA - A Medical RAG Chatbot
**MEDIVA** (Medical Intelligent Virtual Assistant) is a lightweight and modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to assist with medical knowledge and inquiries using custom PDF documents. It leverages powerful embedding models and LLMs for accurate, document-grounded responses.
---
## 🔍 Features
- **RAG Pipeline**: Seamless integration of retrieval and generation.
- **Custom PDF Uploads**: Ask questions based on your own medical documents.
- **Fast Inference**: Powered by GROQ and Langchain for blazing-fast results.
- **Simple UI**: Built with Streamlit, keeping it elegant and responsive.
- **Context-Aware**: Understands medical questions within the scope of provided documents.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **PDF Loader**: Upload medical PDFs (research, notes, articles).
2. **Text Splitter**: Chunks the document into meaningful segments.
3. **Embeddings**: Converts chunks into vector form using HuggingFace embeddings.
4. **Vector Store (FAISS)**: Stores and indexes embeddings for fast retrieval.
5. **Query**: Ask a medical question.
6. **LLM (GROQ)**: Retrieves context chunks and generates a natural language response.
